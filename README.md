# Nano-Virus
Build a nano-virus that kills tumors cells 

This is not yet finished but the basic idea (ground work is mostly done)

I kind of approaced the problem with an game mindset.
The idea was to build a tree of all the possible moves that can be played in a given scenario, so the best way to kill all the turourus cells
or to try and kill all the tumourus cells can be found. Kinda like a chess game, but a chess game is a two player game where this simulation is
more like a one player game with the enviroment playing the same moves(killing the red or white blood cells every two turns) and not reacting
towards the moves played by the player(Nano-virus cell).
